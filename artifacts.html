			<h1><u>Leo Club</u></h1>
			
			<p>I have been involved with Leo Club from 9th grade to the present, 10th grade. In Leo Club, my duties are to volunteer for different events that occur in my community to try to help and better my community, as well as help work events to raise money for the community. I also donate to organizations if they are in need of anything from the community.From being in Leo Club, so far I have gained leadership, volunteer, and teamwork skills. I can apply these skills that I have learned to better suite me for college and my future job. I have learned that it is very important to give back to the community and help it prosper. The skills I've learned in Leo Club also coincide with what I've learned in volleyball and Sophomore Class Cabinet. The teamwork and leadership skills have all been gained through experiences in these three activities. Leo Club has taught me that working by myself isn't always the best. Working with others and each putting in our part, I've found works effectively to reach the goal that we have made as a group. I've learned this skill by volunteering at different events in my community and as a whole club planning events for the community. In the future, I might work with a partner to create a business. So, by gaining teamwork skills now, I can use them in the future when I need to.</p>

			<h1><u>Sophomore Class Cabinet</u></h1>
			
			<p> I was involved in Sophomore Class Cabinet during my sophomore year. In Class Cabinet, my duties are to help raise money for my class so that later on, we can use it towards our prom and senior trip. I also have to come up with ideas to raise money, as well as work to plan and work the events with my classmates so we can make enough money. From being in Class Cabinet, I have gained leadership, teamwork, dedication, and communication skills. I can apply these skills that I have learned to better suite me for college and my future job. I have learned that working with others can effectively help to reach the goal that is set and in order to work with others in a productive way, you have to communicate with them to ensure each goal is accomplished. I have also learned to keep and open mind and consider all ideas so a collaborative environment is kept and we can reach our goal. The skills I've learned in Sophomore Class Cabinet also coincide with what I've learned in volleyball and Leo Club. I have gained leadership and teamwork skills by going through many experiences in these three activities. Class Cabinet has taught me that you have to communicate with others and work together to reach the goal set. I have gained these skills by voicing my opinion on what events we need to plan to raise money and to keep an open mind when my classmates are sharing their opinions. In the future, it's a very likely that I will be working with others. So, by keeping an open mind to my co-workers' ideas and working with them, we can be successful at our jobs.</p>

			<h1><u>Volleyball</u></h1>
			
			<p>I have played volleyball for my school since 7th grade and I am still playing it currently. I also am currently playing for a club team called AIVA and have been playing for this club for 2 years. I have played for the Armstrong River Hawks Girls Junior Varisty Volleyball Team as well as the Ford City Sabers Girls Junior High School Volleyball Team. My duties as a player are to go to every practice/game and give everything I've got out on the court so that I can help my team win. I also have to communicate and work with my teammates so that we can effectively put the ball over the net and score. I have to also put in my part and do my job as a hitter to put the ball where it needs to go so my team can score. From playing volleyball, so far I have gained leadership, perseverance, communication, confidence, and teamwork skills. I can apply these skills that I have learned to better suite me for college, and later my job. I have learned that it is very important to be a leader and pick your team up if they are down or in a slump and losing many points at a time. I also learned that perseverance and confidence is key to to overcoming challenges(games, opponents, and your own record). You have to have the confidence in yourself that you will it the ball and and score a point for your team every time you go up to hit and through perseverance, you can accomplish that goal of getting many kills. I have also learned that communicating and working with my teammates always creates a good outcome. The skills I've learned in playing volleyball also correlate with what I've learned in Sophomore Class Cabinet and Leo Club. Through each I've gained teamwork and leadership skills. Volleyball had taught me that you have to communicate with others and work together to reach the goal set. I have gained these skills by communicating with my teammates to tell them what's going on on the court and working together to win the game. In the future, I will probably work with many other people. So, by communicating with them, we can effectively get our jobs done and by having confidence in myself, I can persevere and do my tasks with 100% certainty that they are done correctly.</p>
