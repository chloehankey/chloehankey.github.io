			<p> I began to read and write at a very young age. My dad has a piece of paper in his wallet of his name that I wrote at the age of 3. My parents always knew I was very smart since I was able to talk and read. This was proven when I went entered into Kindergarten. Halfway through my school year, I was told that I wasn't at the same level as the other kids in my class. Soon, my teacher would pull me up to her desk and have me read books, answer questions, and do math flashcards with her. After this went on, I was notified that my schooling level was not Kindergarten but First Grade. This meant that in order for me to learn anything, I would have to move up to the First Grade. This also meant that I wouldn't have any friends, I would be younger than my whole grade, and my work would be more challenging. I had to overcome my fears and communicate with new people so I could make friends. I also had to work hard and use what I learn to help me. So, from a young age, I had to use communication skills, teamwork skills, and give my all when doing my school work. It was very hard at first but I persevered and now I'm doing great.<p>
